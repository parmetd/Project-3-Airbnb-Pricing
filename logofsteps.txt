First examined what I had in data
Second I went through to think about what factors might effect price and price segmentation drew some hypothesises
Third Look at NAN
Fourth went through doing data cleaning
Fifth went ahead and created a golden database dropping the few NANs
Sixth did some variant tests on both LR, RF and KNN
7th Returned to examine intercept / correlation closely
8th Ran correlation variations on accommodates, beds, bedrooms. Bedrooms won 15% most valuable variable
9th created comfort variation out of that and tested it. Useless.
10th Revisited idea around room_type as its own data set without dummy variable. Major success Entire home runs!
11th Tested availability a30 vs a60 vs a90 vs a365
12th a30 won so added it to the best case Entire Room, Accommodates: SUCCESS .411 from initial 32.64
13th Created function and refactored code
14th new drawing board on ideas and a view simple visuals to help me understand what was going
15th fixed beds bug
--
16th Dropped High prices that were throwing it off to run Random Forest
17th ran city vs zipcode. City determined nothing so dropped.
18th Travis on price per person
19th dummy variable beds+ba
20th for loop Visualizations on each component...
21st Reporting Log Results and print (.append?)
22nd drop max minimum nights to 31 because one result had a 180 night minimum.


cleaniness ratings i have seen elsewhere...
modern dataset
See if I can import reviews from LA dataset and play there
Examine others code


Next time: need to PCA
